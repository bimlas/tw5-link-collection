Have you ever been looking for something on Google and when you found the answer, you wanted to make a note of it, did you realize that you already had the answer in your TiddlyWiki? To avoid these situations by integrating TiddlyWiki search results to your preferred search engine's results, use this userscript with TiddlyWiki on Node.js.

Because the script searches in multiple TiddlyWikis at once, it can also be used to search in all your wikis.
